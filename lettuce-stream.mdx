## Product overview

Lettuce Stream is a web-based multistreaming SaaS platform that combines a modern marketing site with an authenticated streaming dashboard. It lets creators restream to multiple platforms (YouTube, Twitch, Kick) from a single workflow, while keeping onboarding and billing streamlined for self-serve subscriptions.

## Architecture

The system blends a static front end with serverless APIs and real-time streaming infrastructure:

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the marketing site, auth flows, and in-browser studio UI.
- **Backend services:** Firebase Auth and Firestore for identity, user data, and secure token storage.
- **Serverless APIs:** OAuth callbacks, runtime config, and backend glue for auth and channel linking.
- **Streaming relay (in development):** Node-based WebSocket relay that converts MediaRecorder chunks to RTMP via FFmpeg for YouTube Live and other ingest endpoints.

## Core flows

### Authentication and onboarding

Users follow a Stripe-inspired sign-up/sign-in experience, backed by Firebase Auth. Authenticated sessions unlock the streaming dashboard, where user data and channel connections are stored in Firestore.

### Subscriptions and billing

Stripe manages subscription tiers and checkout sessions. The UI exposes plan selection and payment management within the dashboard.

### OAuth multistream linking

Creators connect YouTube and Twitch via serverless OAuth endpoints, which store channel secrets securely using Firebase Admin SDK capabilities.

### Go-live pipeline

The browser-based studio captures media with MediaRecorder, then forwards chunks to the WebSocket relay. The relay transcodes and pushes RTMP to supported streaming platforms (in progress).

## Key capabilities and modules

- **Marketing + Auth UX:** Responsive landing pages, pricing, and polished sign-up/sign-in flows.
- **Streaming Studio & Dashboard:** Multistream controls, platform toggles, and storage views for past sessions.
- **Firebase Integration:** Auth, Firestore data access, and server-side Admin SDK for secure token handling.
- **Stripe Payments:** Subscription tiers, checkout session creation, and billing management.
- **OAuth Multistreaming:** Serverless endpoints for channel linking and token storage.
- **Live Relay (under development):** WebSocket bridge from browser media capture to RTMP ingest via FFmpeg.
- **Automation:** Scheduled spotlight scanning scripts that pull upcoming events from YouTube/Twitch/Kick and persist them to Firestore.

## Tech stack summary

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JS
- **Backend:** Firebase Auth + Firestore, serverless API routes
- **Payments:** Stripe
- **Streaming infra (under development):** WebSocket relay + FFmpeg → RTMP
- **Automation:** Node scripts + scheduled CI jobs

## Deployment

- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting for the static frontend, with optional deployments on Vercel or Netlify.
- **Serverless:** API routes deployed alongside the frontend stack.
- **Ops:** Managed Firebase services minimize backend maintenance overhead.

## Operational automation

Daily spotlight scans query upcoming events across streaming platforms, normalize the data, and persist it in Firestore to power dashboard views and marketing highlights.
